Intern Experience
-----------------

* In January to February 2012, at _Hulu_'s Research team, I helped to build a prototype of P2P video-on-demand `Flash` client in `ActionScript`.
* In December 2011, at _Hulu_'s Engineering Excellence team, I helped to build a automatic testing framework for `Flash` applications in `C#` using `WebDriver`.
* In April to May 2011, at _Internet Graphics Group_ of _Microsoft Research Asia_, I improved the demo program of _TransCut_ project by adding `Natural User Interface`, where I designed and implemented the body gesture UI using `Kinect`.
* In February to March 2011, at _Innovation Engineering Center_ of _Microsoft Research Asia_, I participated in the development of _Bing Dictionary_'s desktop client. I designed and implemented some core algorithms being used in both client and server side, mainly in `Natural Language Processing` field.

Open Source Experience
----------------------

* In September 2012, I created `GoLio` (https://github.com/tianyicui/golio), which is a `Lisp` dialect implemented in `OCaml` with a `Go`-like concurrency model (i.e, goroutines and channels).
* I submitted patches to various open source projects; most of them got accepted. The notable projects are `Homebrew`, `RVM`, `RSpec`, `SimpleCov`, `highlighting-kate`, and `Redcar`. More details on https://github.com/tianyicui.

Education
---------

* I am an undergraduate in College of Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University, and expected to graduated in June 2013.

Notes
-----

* This resume was created using `Vim` and `AsciiDoc`, then spell checked with `Aspell`. The process of generating HTML and uploading it to my server is automated by using `Make`, `Git` and `OpenSSH`.
* The latest version of my resume is always available online in http://tianyicui.com/resume.txt[plain text] and http://tianyicui.com/resume.html[HTML].
