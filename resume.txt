Objective
---------

* Build tools that make programmers' life more fulfilling, including mine.

Skills
------

.Algorithm design, analysis and implementation

* I am quite proficient in ACM/ICPC-level algorithmic problem-solving.
* I am experienced with implementing algorithms based on textbooks and research papers.

.Programming skills

* Writing clean code in `C++`, `C`, `C#`, `Python`, and `Ruby` with practical experiences.
* Interested in functional programming language such as `Haskell`, `Scheme` and `F#`.
* Web development with `Rails` and `Django`.
* DSL (domain specific language) design and implementation in `Ruby`.
* Software testing with `RSpec` and `NUnit`.
* Embedded `Linux` development in `C`, especially device driver implementation and system integration.
* Lexical analysis and parsing with `flex`, `bison` and `treetop`.

.Programming tools

* Source code management: `Git`, `Mercurial`, `Subversion`, `Visual SourceSafe`.
* Editor/IDE: `Vim`, `Visual Studio`.
* Operating systems: `Mac OS X`, `Windows`, and `Linux` (especially `Debian`, `Ubuntu` and `ArchLinux`).
* I also have rich experience with common `Unix` command line utilities.

.General skills

* Excellent quick learning and problem-solving ability under time constraints.
* Critical thinking and effective communication.

Academic Achievements
---------------------

.ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest

* Harbin Regional, Gold Medal, 2008
* Hangzhou Regional, Gold Medal, 2008
* Hefei Regional (team leader), Gold Medal, 2009
* Wuhan Regional (team leader), Gold Medal, 2009

.Zhejiang Provincial Collegiate Programming Contest

* 1st place, 2009
* 1st place, 2010

Commercial Project Experience
-----------------------------

* In February to March 2011, I participated in the development of the desktop client of _Bing Dictionary_ at the _Lingo_ group of _MSRA-IEG_. I designed and implemented some core algorithms being used in both client and server side.
* In April to May 2011, I improved the demo program of _TransCut_ project by adding `Natural User Interface`. I designed and implemented the body gesture UI using `Kinect`.
* In June 2010, I built a customized version of `WebKit` for _Hercules_ (part of _Guillemot Corporation_) with the main purpose of reducing memory footprint to be used in an embedded environment.
* In August 2009, I ported the `Linux` kernel along with `uClibc` and `BusyBox` userland to a customized embedded board based on `AT91RM9200` chip for _Sinostride Technology_. I also wrote the essential device drivers as loadable kernel modules. The system is now widely deployed as the monitoring system in _China Unicom_'s 3G base stations.
* In July 2009, I developed the prototype of a Facebook application using `Ruby on Rails` and `Apache Thrift` for _RomanLogic LLC_.
* In June 2009, I developed a `.Net` RPC framework using `Protocol Buffer` and implemented the multi-threaded socket server in `C#`, for a client of _TopCoder, Inc._ codenamed _SP-14_.

Open Source Experience
----------------------

* In 2010, I made significant contribution to the `Homebrew` project, a package manager and porting system for `Mac OS X` entirely written in `Ruby`. More than a dozen software packages are ported to `Mac OS X` and carefully packaged by me.
* I submitted patches to various open source projects; most of them got accepted. The notable projects are `RVM`, `RSpec`, `SimpleCov`, `highlighting-kate`, and `Redcar`. More details on https://github.com/tianyicui.

Education
---------

* I am currently a 4th-grade undergraduate in College of Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University.

Hobbies
-------

* Enjoying classical music.
* Reading books on psychology and philosophy.
* Watching Japanese animation.

Notes
-----

* This resume was created using `Vim` and `AsciiDoc`, then spell checked with `Aspell`. The process of generating HTML and uploading it to my server is automated by using `Make`, `Git` and `OpenSSH`.
* The latest version of my resume is always available online in http://tianyicui.com/resume.txt[plain text] and http://tianyicui.com/resume.html[HTML].
