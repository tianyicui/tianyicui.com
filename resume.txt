Objectives
----------

* Overcome cognitive biases and practice the art of human rationality.
* Reach mastery in computer programming and build mechanisms to make programmers' life more fulfilling.

Skills
------

.Algorithm design, analysis and implementation

* I am quite proficient in ACM/ICPC-level algorithmic problem-solving.
* I am experienced with implementing algorithms based on textbooks and research papers.

.Programming skills

* Writing clean code in `C`, `C#`, `Python`, `Ruby` and `OCaml` with practical experiences.
* Interested in functional programming languages such as `Haskell`, `Erlang`, `F#`, `Scala`, `Clojure`, `Scheme`, `Common Lisp`.
* Web development with `Rails` and `Django`.
* Domain specific language design and implementation in `Ruby`.
* Software testing with `RSpec` and `NUnit`.
* Embedded `Linux` development in `C`, especially device driver implementation and system integration.
* Lexical analysis and parsing with `flex`, `bison` and `treetop`.

.Programming tools

* Source code management: `Git`, `Mercurial`, `Subversion`.
* Editor/IDE: `Vim`, `Visual Studio`.
* Operating systems: `Mac OS X`, `Windows`, and `Linux` (especially `Debian`, `Ubuntu` and `ArchLinux`).
* I also have rich experience with common `Unix` command line utilities.

.General skills

* Excellent quick learning and problem-solving ability under time constraints.
* Critical thinking and effective communication.
* Pragmatic English technical writing skills.

Academic Achievements
---------------------

.ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest

* Harbin Regional, Gold Medal, 2008
* Hangzhou Regional, Gold Medal, 2008
* Hefei Regional (team leader), Gold Medal, 2009
* Wuhan Regional (team leader), Gold Medal, 2009

.Zhejiang Provincial Collegiate Programming Contest

* 1st place, 2009

Commercial Project Experience
-----------------------------

* In January to February 2012, I helped to build a prototype of P2P video-on-demand `Flash` client in `ActionScript` at _Research Group_ of _Hulu_.
* In December 2011, I helped to build a automatic testing framework for `Flash` applications in `C#` using `WebDriver` at _Engineering Excellence Group_ of _Hulu_.
* In April to May 2011, I improved the demo program of _TransCut_ project by adding `Natural User Interface` at _Internet Graphics Group_ of _Microsoft Research Asia_, where I designed and implemented the body gesture UI using `Kinect`.
* In February to March 2011, I participated in the development of the desktop client of _Bing Dictionary_ at the _Lingo_ group of _Innovation Engineering Center_ of _Microsoft Research Asia_. I designed and implemented some core algorithms being used in both client and server side, mainly in `Natural Language Processing` field.

Open Source Experience
----------------------

* In September 2012, I created `GoLio` (https://github.com/tianyicui/golio), which is a `Lisp` dialect implemented in `OCaml` with a `Go`-like concurrency model (i.e, goroutines and channels).
* In 2010, I made significant contribution to the `Homebrew` project, a package manager and porting system for `Mac OS X` entirely written in `Ruby`. More than a dozen software packages are ported to `Mac OS X` and carefully packaged by me.
* I submitted patches to various open source projects; most of them got accepted. The notable projects are `RVM`, `RSpec`, `SimpleCov`, `highlighting-kate`, and `Redcar`. More details on https://github.com/tianyicui.

Education
---------

* I am an undergraduate in College of Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University, and expected to graduated in June 2013.

Hobbies
-------

* Enjoying classical music, especially Bach.
* Reading books on psychology and philosophy.
* Watching Japanese animation.

Notes
-----

* This resume was created using `Vim` and `AsciiDoc`, then spell checked with `Aspell`. The process of generating HTML and uploading it to my server is automated by using `Make`, `Git` and `OpenSSH`.
* The latest version of my resume is always available online in http://tianyicui.com/resume.txt[plain text] and http://tianyicui.com/resume.html[HTML].
